- 👋 Hi, I’m @accancio (Tony Cancio), a professor in physics at Ball State University.
- 👀 I’m interested in developing orbital free density functional models and methods for calculating the electronic structure of materials.  I have also worked on quantum Monte Carlo methods for electronic structure, and worked on developing exchange and correlation functionals for density functional calculations.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about machine learning tools and data visualization tools for helping me model the 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on -- well I teach a lot so don't have much opportunity for coding, but anything to do with electronic structure calculations in principle.
